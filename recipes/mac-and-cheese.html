        <p id="description">This homemade mac and cheese is topped with buttered bread crumbs for pure comfort food. 
            It's easy to make the cheese sauce from scratch, starting with a roux and adding 
            milk, Cheddar, and Parmesan to make a rich, decadent sauce that coats every nook and cranny of the noodles.</p>

        <h3>Directions: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="directions">Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
            <li class="directions">To make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; 
                it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li class="directions">While the macaroni is cooking, melt &frac14; cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. 
                Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li class="directions">Gradually whisk 2 &frac12; cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li class="directions">Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper.
                 Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to &frac12; cup more milk if needed.</li>
            <li class="directions">Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
            <li class="directions">Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned.</li>
            <li class="directions">Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
            <li class="directions">Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
